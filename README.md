# Pong-online
A very, very poor implementation of a very old game called pong, but it's online.

To run on your own pc follow this steps:
1. Install nodejs
2. Download the repository from github
3. Open the downloaded folder in a terminal and type: npm i
4. After all the libraries have installed, type: node .
5. The server defaults to port 3000, so if you want to connect to it from your pc go on localhost:3000 in the browser
6. If you want to connect to it from any other computer use ip:3000
